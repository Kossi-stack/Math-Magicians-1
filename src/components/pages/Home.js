        <p className="description">Having a basic understanding of the development of technology over the course of history can help us to predict the potential growth of technology to come. Here, the professionals at Techmart take you through the history of the calculator, and how we came to have the ubiquitous devices we use every day. It is almost impossible for us to imagine mathematics without something as seemingly simple as a calculator. That being said, the calculators we know today were not invented until the 1970s, and the use of smartphones as calculators did not begin until at least the late nineties. But that doesn’t mean that mathematical tools were not available before the 20th century—there were many different computing machines created long before digital calculators and smartphones.</p>
        <p className="description">In 1642, the first true “calculator” was invented: one that performed calculations through a clockwork-type of mechanism. The Pascal calculator, invented by French inventor and mathematician Blaise Pascal, was lauded for attempting arithmetic calculations previously thought impossible. But unfortunately, they were difficult to produce and very few were ever made. The mechanical calculator then invented by Thomas de Colmar in the mid-nineteenth century, and subsequent others, were easier to produce, but extremely large and bulky–not at all the pocket calculators we know today.</p>
